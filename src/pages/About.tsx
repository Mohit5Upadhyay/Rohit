            About Rohit
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300 mb-4">
            Hello, my name is Rohit Upadhyay, and I'm a storyteller, aspiring
            author, and writer at heart. From my earliest days of writing plays
            and dramas in school that vividly portrayed various characters to
            crafting tales that explored the essence of existence, writing has
            always been very close to my heart and a way for me to interact with
            the outside world.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300 mb-4">
            The journey has not been without challenges. Despite having an MBA
            in Health Management and having walked the corridors of structure
            and strategy, my heart has always been in the unrestricted world of
            creativity.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300 mb-4">
            As a writer, I want my words to sound like a friend's voice,
            providing guidance, comfort, and sometimes a gentle reminder to
            appreciate the beauty in your story. Just like my writing, my
            relationship with each reader is unique. Whether you want to think,
            explore, or find a different perspective, youâ€™ll get all dimensions
            to read. And know this, I craft words by having you in mind always.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300 mb-4">
            Greetings from my world, where stories are more than just words;
            they serve as tools for understanding, healing, and personal
            development.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
            I'm very happy you're here. :)
          </p>
